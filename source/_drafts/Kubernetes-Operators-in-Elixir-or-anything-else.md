The Pivotal Dublin office host a pair of pivots working on the [Eirini](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/) project, when the Eirini team hosted a Hackday it was open to all the office and I was able to partecipate.

Not knowing a lot about Eirini I joined Alex working on his plan to have Eirini create a [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) with a custom controller to create the objects necessary when Eirini push a workload to a cluster. In the actual implementation is Eirini itself creating the objects (statefulsets, routes, ...) on the cluster.
